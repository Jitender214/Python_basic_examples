#StringIO
#the StringIO module implements an in-memory file like object. this object can then be used as
#input or output to most functions that would expect a standard file object


#import StringIO
#message = 'This is normal string'

#f = StringIO.StringIO(message)
#f.read()
#f.write('second line would like to add to file')
